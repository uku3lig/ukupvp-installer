**Modified version by uku, adapted for [uku's pvp modpack.](https://modrinth.com/modpack/ukupvp)**

Devin's modpacks, [Additive](https://github.com/intergrav/Additive) and [Adrenaline](https://github.com/intergrav/Adrenaline), require you to use a third-party launcher to install and run them, which can be a bit of a hassle for some users. This program aims to solve this issue by allowing you to easily install either modpack onto the default Minecraft launcher, without requiring any third-party tools. 

Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/Gaming32/additive-installer/releases) page to download and run the installer. `jar` files are provided for all operating systems, and `exe` files are alternatively provided - Windows only.
